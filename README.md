### Instructor: [](https://tutsplus.com/authors/kezz-bracey)

In this course you’ll learn how to design web typography for a website using Figma. Throughout the coming lessons you’ll implement an extensive repertoire of typographic principles we’ve covered in our Tuts+ tutorials across the years.

This is the first of a two part course, covering the most important fundamentals of web typography. By the end of the course you’ll have a clear understanding of how to select and pair fonts, how to set up your text sizes in a flowing and practical way, how to properly plan for spacing throughout your typography, and when to create overrides for the text styles you have established.
